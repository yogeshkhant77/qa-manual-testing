# API Testing – Postman

This folder contains API testing artifacts created using **Postman**, demonstrating
my understanding of backend testing without UI dependency.

All APIs were tested independently by sending HTTP requests and validating
responses such as status codes, response body, and error messages.

---

##  Tools Used
- Postman
- REST APIs
- JSON

---

##  Folder Contents

### 1️ Postman Collection
- `postman_collection.json`
- Contains API requests for:

  - Status code verification (200, 400, 401, 404, 500)
  - Response body validation
  - Input validation and error handling

---

### 3️ API Bug Examples
- `api_bug_reports.md`
- Sample bugs logged for:
  - Incorrect status codes
  - Invalid response data
  - Missing validations
